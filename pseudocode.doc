Pseudocode
create 3 classes as per the requirment
the first class is for the door object the second class is for the game object and the third class is for storing the results of the game simulation.
most of the work/coding should be in the game class.
create 3 keys to creat 3 door object in the game class.
on the ky doors creat a array of the three doors.
create a method that returns a value for every key and call the method in the class against the respective keys.

method for door picked shoud include a function to choose a random object from th doors arrar(key)

method  for the goat door opened should return a door object that is not the doorpicked and that doesnt have a car in it and should change the key opened of the returned object to true.

method for finalpick should take a parameter that can be used for a true or false question. this is the parameter that decides to chage the door or not.
this method return the same object as door picked if the parameter doest want to change the choice.
if the parameter does ask to change then the return object should have the key opend as fase and should not be the same as door picked.

method for the won key shouold return a true or false statement saying if the player won or lost.the player wins in the key is car is equal to true in the object finalpick else he looses.

now after all the 3 classes are created its time to create a main function.
the main finction should creat a object from the class statistic and run the game and store the results of the game in the object created. this function should also have a for loop that runns the game x amount of time.the x amount of time should be a parameter passed in to the function.
at the end should console log the results.
